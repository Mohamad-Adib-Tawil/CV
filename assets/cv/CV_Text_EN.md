## Professional Summary (EN)
Mid-level Flutter Developer (3+ yrs). Shipped 4 apps (4+ star rating, 1,000+ installs). Realtime (Zego/WebSocket), Clean Architecture (BLoC), offline AR/EN OCR. Strong focus on performance optimization (-60% memory), CI/CD automation, and secure data handling. Currently advancing CI fundamentals with GitHub Actions (triggers, flutter analyze/test, build artifacts, secrets, caching/concurrency). Open to remote full‑time/contract.

## Work Experience (EN)
### Freelance Flutter Developer (2022 - Present)
- End-to-end delivery: requirements, UX flows, implementation, deployment, analytics, and iteration.
- Built and shipped 4 production apps with 1,000+ total downloads and 4+ average rating on Google Play.
- Optimized LKLK social audio platform to reliably sustain 1,000+ concurrent users per room in production, with measurable latency improvements via smart caching and adaptive performance modes.
- Engineered offline AR/EN OCR pipeline (Office Archiving), reducing processing time by 40% through enhanced preprocessing.
- Implemented Supabase Auth + realtime chat (Wolfera), increasing engagement by ~60%.
- Delivered pixel-perfect, multilingual UIs (AR/EN) with responsive layouts.
